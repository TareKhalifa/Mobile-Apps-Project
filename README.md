### Ez Money
- Ez Money is an applocation that is targeting a problem that arises whenever group events and outings occur. Basically, many people spend money on items that are for the whole group and as the number of gorup members and contributers increase, it gets more difficult to find out who owes whome what. Here, Ez Money comes to save the day. By signing in with your google account, you can either create or join a group with your friends, where you can add your expenses and who they were directed to. Then, people can settle their debts towards each other hassle free.
